# Tiki-Sales-Prediction

## Problem Statement: 

The e-commerce sector is rapidly growing, influenced by numerous factors that affect sales and demand. With the rising popularity of various trends, it has become challenging to determine a product's popularity accurately. This creates a need for effective inventory management, ensuring that supply aligns with demand.

The goal of this project is to leverage the power of data analytics to build a predictive model that forecasts sales demand. This model will help optimize inventory management for online retail sellers by predicting the `quantity_sold` of a product. 

The data that we will be analysing on contains `18` variables and `44804` observations. <br>
